    <h2>Candle Picture</h2>
    <p><a></a></p>
    <p>This picture was one of the first pictures I was able to make using code. I used elements such as RGB and shapes to create it. I also found out how to dim or make a light brighter which created the glowing candle effect. One of the challenges I faced was creating the candle’s shadow, as I wasn’t very good with overlapping shapes but I eventually got over it.</p>

    <h2>Polygon Generator</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898515636"></a></p>
    <p>A partner and I coded this game to draw different polygons based on size and location. At first, this was a difficult task and it seemed much more complex than it was actually. We eventually figured out that the main idea behind the game would be to find a formula that could calculate the outside angles of each polygon simply based on the amount of slides it has. Once we figured this out we were able to apply it to every polygon, the only difference we had to make in the code was the angle that we would turn the sprite. It was interesting seeing how math and coding go together.</p>

      <h2>Robotic Bug</h2>
      <p><a></a></p>
      <p>This was a project I made during freshman year, it was a robotic bug that had glowing red eyes and would walk forward if I remember correctly. This was a project that I soldered, which meant there was some room for error, and I did make a few mistakes while creating it. For example, when I soldered the battery piece to the back of the bug, A small piece of solder got stuck, so the bug wouldn’t turn on. I didn’t know this was the cause until thoroughly troubleshooting but eventually I figured it out. I also had slight trouble with soldering the legs but that was simply due to my inexperience. After all was said and done, the project came out amazing and I was shocked to see how well it worked.</p>
